# Hollow And Welcome On My GitHub Account!

![](assets/disined.gif)
### This account is for development. I don't post my projects here.
My experience in back-end development is more than 2 years.I started with python, now stayed on golang.
I don't think that go is a magic pill that will solve all the problems in the backend, but I think it is very elegant and very practical.
